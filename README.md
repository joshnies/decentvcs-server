## Environment

#### Dotenv

Create a new `.env` file in the root directory, using the `.env.example` file for reference.

#### Doppler

We recommend using [Doppler](https://doppler.com) in deployed environments for enhanced security.

## Running (local development)

```sh
# With dotenv
go run main.go

# With doppler
./run
# or
doppler run -- go run main.go
```

## Build

```sh
./install.sh
```

It should be added to your path automatically. You can then run the built executable by running:

```sh
dvcs-server
```
