# DecentVCS

Core server for DecentVCS, the simple, affordable, and decentralized version control system.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `go`       | 1.19+   |

## Environment

#### Dotenv

Create a new `.env` file in the root directory, using the `.env.example` file for reference.

#### Doppler

We recommend using [Doppler](https://doppler.com) in deployed environments for enhanced security.

## Running (local development)

```sh
# With dotenv
go run main.go

# With doppler
./run
# or
doppler run -- go run main.go
```

## Build

```sh
./install.sh
```

It should be added to your path automatically. You can then run the built executable by running:

```sh
dvcs-server
```

## Using the REST API

### Authentication

We use Stytch for session-based authentication. Once the user goes through one of Stytch's auth flows, you'll receive
a session token that can be sent with any request to the VCS server as the `X-Session-Token` header.

Example request:

```
POST /projects/myteam/myproject
X-Session-Token: ****1234
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "hello": "world"
}
```

#### Access keys

You can also use **access keys** to authenticate with the VCS server. These are generated by the client application and
are scoped to specific functionality.

Access keys expire after 24 hours, and should be deleted by the client application after use.

Example request:

```
PUT /teams/myteam
X-Access-Key: ****1234
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "storage_used_mb": 12.34
}
```
